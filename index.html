<p>Nothing is known of how Hoover came to be. His early life is shrouded in mystery. Legend has it that he was found by Animal Control wandering the streets of Taft, California when he was about a year old. Through some stroke of luck, he evaded an early
  death when he was transferred to a no-kill animal shelter in Santa Maria, California. There he was assigned the name of Lucky. Reportedly, the young dog was shocked, scared and disoriented, falling into a lethargic depression. Luckily for Lucky, all
  of this was soon to change.</p>

<h2 id='cal' style="clear:right;">Life in California.</h2>
<p>In late summer of 2011, a young woman living with her husband in Arroyo Grande, California visited the Santa Maria Animal Shelter to investigate a dog for adoption she had seen in a newspaper ad. Her beloved dog of 14 years had recently died and she felt
  an emptiness demanding to be filled. The dog she came to see was unavailable but there, alone and forlorn in the corner of the dog area, sat the little dog she knew would be her joy for years to come. She was Mom, and he became Hoover (because he was
  from Taft - Presidents,get it!). Hoover came to live with Mom (and her husband, Dad) in Arroyo Grande. Things started roughly as Dad dropped Hoover’s leash getting out of the car. This caused Hoover to panic and race into the chaparral, leash clattering
  behind him. All turned out well, though. Hoover was recovered after being trapped by his brush-entangled leash. Hoover adjusted to life, becoming energetic and playful. He found his bed and immediately snuggled into it.</p>

<p>He was very well house-trained and never had indoor accidents. Mom got up every morning a fed him a bowl of home-made dog food consisting of turkey, rice, sweet potato and carrots. Before work, she took him out for a rapid ‘death-march’ walk around the neighborhood.
  In the evening, Mom took him to the dog park or the beach where he would run off-leash and play and wrestle with other dogs.</p>

<p>Mom took Hoover to school for training. He graduated with a certificate in specializations of “sit”, “down” and “heel”. Every couple of weeks, Mom took Hoover with her to Los Angeles to visit with her dad. Grandad was always especially happy to see Hoover,
  and fed him lots of treats under the table. Mom also took Hoover to her work office. She took his bed so that, when Hoover was not having fun with people in the office, he curled up and slept. Wherever Hoover went he was happy, playful, and gentle.
  He delighted everyone.

<p>In the summer of 2015, Hoover's Mom and Dad no longer left him alone at home during the daytime.  They had retired, and that meant big changes were coming!  In Winter,  Hoover jumped into the car for a long trip.  He was leaving California to go to the snow!  Mom bought Hoover a nice down coat, and off they all went.  Hoover did not know what snow was or what it was good for.  He first met the cold white stuff when he jumped out of the car for a rest break at Donner Summit.  He loved it from the first moment.  A day later he arrived at his new home in the Rocky Mountains and the whole world was white and cold.  He walked in the dog park twice a day a frolicked around the snowman and the snow fort.  He had his own nice fur coat and never used the one Mom bought him.  He did get annoying ice balls caught in his foot pads, but this was a small sacrifice for all the fun. </p>

<p>When the weather got a little warmer, Hoover got in the car to leave the mountains.  To his surprise (and happiness), he didn’t.  He was in the car for about five minutes before he got out and entered his new house.  It was nice and cozy.  He found his bed and nice spots on the couch and in front of the fireplace.  He had a new walk route around the block in his new neighborhood.  Soon the bare aspen trees started to show nice green buds.  Rabbits, chipmunks, magpies and more appeared. Spring had come.</p>
